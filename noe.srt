1
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,830
Oh.

2
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,998
Thanks.

3
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,313
Hello?

4
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,313
Oh, hi.

5
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,692
How... Oh, I just got in.

6
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,159
No, I mean I literally
just stepped off the plane.

7
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,745
I'm not even in the terminal yet.

8
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,535
What's wrong?

9
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,795
Fucking assholes!
Where the fuck have you been?

10
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,962
You know, we have missed one plane,
and now we're gonna miss another one!

11
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,429
You know, this is my ass on the line,
and if I lose my job because of you crazy...

12
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,013
<i>Hey.</i> That's 30 bucks.

13
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,431
Here you go.
Keep the change.

14
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,429
Come on, guys. Let's...
What are you doing?

15
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,601
Hello? Could we please go?

16
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,227
All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's...

17
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:26,278
Come on, you guys. Get it together.
It's this way. This way! Let's go!

18
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,993
OK. OK. I'll call him.

19
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:38,085
No, I promise I'll call him
just as soon as I get my luggage.

20
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,921
Oh, no, I'm really looking forward to it.

21
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,131
Thank you.

22
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,797
Damn.

23
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,979
<i>The white zone

Yeah, this is Corky, car number 36.
Boss told me to call in.

27
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,008
Hello. Victoria Snelling
calling for Mr Pitt.

28
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,386
Yes, I can wait.

29
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,538
Hey, Ray. It's me, Corky.
I'm phoning in.

30
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,075
Yeah, I'm out at the airport.

31
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,205
Oh, I don't know.
It's the executive terminal or something.

32
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,753
I don't know.
I've never been here before.

33
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,256
No, man. Everything's cool.

34
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,380
But listen.
This car runs like shit, man.

35
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,350
I had to pull the plugs myself
this afternoon.

36
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,101
Yeah, I know I'm not, but you better
tell Gonzalez to get his ass in gear,

37
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,101
or else I'm gonna have to be
your fucking mechanic.

38
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,740
Larry. Larry, Victoria.

39
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,204
Yes. I'm... I'm at the airport.
Excuse all the noise.

40
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,041
I'm... I'm at the baggage claim.

41
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,954
Well, I... I, um...

42
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,172
I'm hoping that you have
some good news for me

43
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,632
about that last actress I sent you.

44
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,797
No, man. Everything's great.

45
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,639
In fact, I got a really big tip
from these, like, musician dudes.

46
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,718
Hey, Ray. Have you ever heard
of a band called Utensil?

47
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,889
No, listen.
I brought back seven tapes

48
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,484
of the most sensational
young actresses in the country.

49
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,695
No, not just New York.
Uh, Chicago,

50
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,735
Minneapolis, Seattle,

51
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,109
San Francisco.

52
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,488
Hey, they're all unknown. Yes.

53
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,082
Oh, they're wonderful.
They are just so wonderful.

54
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,910


55
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,879
I... I like them all.

56
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,545
It really has to be your decision.

57
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,384
You know, why don't I bring them by?

58
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,504
I'll just stop by my house for a few minutes
and then I'll come right over.

59
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,971
Yeah, I got you, Ray.

60
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,842
We'll sit down,
and we'll look at 'em together, OK?

61
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,344
OK. I'll get a fare here,
then I'll head back downtown.

62
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,188
Take It easy.
You're just gonna love one of these kids.

63
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,853
Don't worry about nothin', boss.

64
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,023
Relax, OK?
See you in a few.

65
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,612
Hey, Ray. I'm not a kid, OK?

66
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,153
Yeah.

67
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,321
Shit.

68
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,531
Hey, you need a cab, lady?

69
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,577
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Yeah, I'm right here.

70
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,127
- You're a taxi driver?
- Yeah.

71
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,751
OK. I, uh...

72
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,923
Yeah. Why not?

73

00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,166
Be careful with that, will you?
I'm a little in love with my luggage.

80
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,376
No problem, lady.

81
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,135
Ah, ah! I'll carry that with me.
Thank you.

82
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,299
OK.

83
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,595
Thank you.

84
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,429
Let me get...

85
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,431
- I need that leg.
- Sorry.

86
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,524
- Just take It...
- Sony.

87
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,519
- Yeah.
- You in?

88
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,862
Yes. Thank you.

<i>The white zone is for immediate loading

90
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,367
Oh, shit.

91
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,414
- What? What's wrong?
- Oh, fuck.

92
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,414
Nothin'. Damn it.

93
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,462
Where to?

94
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,585
Beverly Hills, please.

95
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,215
Uh, 6754.

96
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,051
6549.

00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,925
Damn!

98
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,639
What's the matter?

99
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:29,012
Oh, I left my phone book back in
the suitcase with all my numbers in it.

100
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,513
- I'm afraid we'll have to pull over...
- Is it listed?

101
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,685
- Listed?
- Yes, it's a...

102
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,980
It's a hotel I've called a million...

103
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,439
Why, thank you. Thank you.

104
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,238
No problem.
Just pass It back up when you're done.

105
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,532
Are you OK without it up there?

106
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,993
Don't worry about it.

107
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,842
Suite 216, please.

108
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,480
Carol. Victoria.

109
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,310
Yes. I, uh... I just spoke to him.

110
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,773
Oh, he's going nuts as usual.
Ricocheting off the walls.

111
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,025
I don't know
what to do with him any more.

112
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,280
I sent him ten actresses
who were perf... well...

113
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,372
Six of them were perfect.

114
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,243
But he just keeps... he keeps
wanting them younger and younger.

115
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,418
Now he wants someone 18
with absolutely no experience,

116
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,541
but the nerves of a paratrooper.

117
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,340
He's not human.
I think he's an android.

118
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,338
Yeah.

119
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,261
Listen. I'm gonna have
to go over there with those tapes

120
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,602
I brought back from, uh...

121
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,347
Carol, I... I, uh... I'm going...

122
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,475
I... I'm supposed to have dinner
with Peter and Shera tonight.

123
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,736
But-II

124
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,698
Will you hold on a second, please? Miss.

125
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,989
Would <i>you</i> please...

126
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,829
<i>Just turn the music off?</i>

127
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,329
- Sure, mom.
- Thank you.

128
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,286
This is my day.

129
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,915
OK. Where were we?

130
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:25,009
Oh, yes. Will you call them
and explain and tell them why I can't?

131
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,719
Great.

132
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,180
Sten.
Were there any messages for me?

133
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,841
Uh-huh.

134
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,104
Uh-huh.

135
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,063
Carol...

136
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,854
Did Mr Kincade call?

137
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,534
You're sure?

138
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,744
OK.

139
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,785
OK.

140
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,459
OK, then. I will, um...

141
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,545
PM... I'll talk to you tomorrow.

142
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,880
Great. Bye-bye.

143
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,445
Is Mr Kincade, like, your boyfriend?

144
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,157
Yes, he is.

145
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,744
At least, I think he is.

146
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,086
Guys. Can't live with 'em,
can't shoot 'em.

147
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,377
Yeah. You can say that again.

148
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,923
Oh, your phone book.
Here. Thanks a lot.

149
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,971
Sure.

150
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,756
Boy, it sure gets dark fast
in the winter, doesn't it?

151
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,132
Driving at night
doesn't seem to bother you.

152
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,134
<i>Why should it?</i>

153
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,262
Oh, with me it's a big problem.
I have night blindness.

154
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,315
Is that, like, something
that happens when you get old?

155
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,155
No. No. Actually, it isn't.

156
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,867
It has nothing to do with age.
I've had it all my life.

157
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,587
Fuckin' A, man.
That's fucked.

158
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,910
Oh, thank you.

159
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,958
Thank you.

160
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,263
You know, it really isn't any of my business,
but you smoke too much.

161
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,725
OK, mom.

162
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,980
You're really happy driving this taxi,
aren't you?

163
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,066
Fuck, yes.

164
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,983
I mean, yeah. It's a cool job.

165
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,988
But, I mean,
is that your whole goal in life?

166
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,987
Driving taxi cabs?

167
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,239
Is there somethin' wrong with that?

168
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,367
No, no, no. I'm sorry. I... I...

169
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,295
I really didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

170
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,427
Yeah, well, I'll tell you somethin'.

171
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,929
I don't always want to be a cab driver.

172
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,060
- What do you really want to be?
- A mechanic.

173
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,357
A mechanic?

174
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,821
I practically know
all there is to know about it.

175
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,816
Both my brothers are mechanics.

176
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,444
They're older than me, but,
you know, cos I'm, like, a girl,

177
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,491
and I'm, like, still kind of young and all,

178
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,706
I gotta kind of, like,
work up to it, you know.

179
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,044
What about marriage
and a family?

180
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,005
Definitely.
Definitely want a family.

181
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,376
Boys, though. Lots of boys.

182
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,630
No girls?
Girls are nice too, I think.

183
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,349
Yeah. Maybe some girls too.

184
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,391
But, you know, like, that stuff...
that's all beside the point.

185
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,560
The real problem is to find
a good guy for the father.

186
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,184
Huh. Tell me about it.

187
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,903
Well, I'm real particular, you know.

188
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,404
And I'm also patient enough.
I mean, at least, I hope I am.

189
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,783
Cos, you know... I don't know...
maybe you gotta wait a while, you know...

190
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:52,379
cos, like, maybe it's not so easy to find,
like, the exact right guy, you know.

191
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,873
Like, the one guy, you know?

192
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,709
No.

193
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,554
- Another mechanic, maybe.
- Hell, I don't care what he does.

194
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,424
As long as he loves me right.

195
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,926
With his soul.

196
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,475
You know, takes me for who I am.

197
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,439
I know what you mean.

198
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,819
Like Popeye says, "I am what I am."

199
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,567
Right?

200
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,035
Yes. You certainly are.

201
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,457
Hello? Oh, hi, Marty.

202
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,210
Yes. I talked to him.

203
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,458
Of course I know what he wants.

204
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
I've heard it a hundred times.

205
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,797
Oh, Marty.
Go ahead. Just tell me again.

206
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,729
Try driving school,
you fucking nimrod!

207
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,985
Marty...

208
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,446
I may be having a brilliant streak
right here in the taxi.

209
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,995
Yes, I'm really in a taxi.

210
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,334
No, I can't tell you right now.

211
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,204
Um...

212
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,377
all I can say is...

213
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,545
I have an idea.

214
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:08,010
No. That's why
I don't tell you things, Marty.

215
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,641
I'm sorry I sound calm.
I assure you I'm hysterical.

216
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,310
I'll call you the minute I know anything.

217
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,400
Goodbye, Mar... Goodbye, Marty.

218
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,238
All right. This is Beverly Drive
coming up. Where to?

219
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,155
Uh, just turn right on Beverly Court,

220
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,450
then follow the hill
up to Beverly Circle, please.

221
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,618
Got ya.

222
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,636
It's up on the left. 971.

223
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,660
Want me to take these
in the house for you?

224
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,119
No, that's OK.

225
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,367
- Just put 'em over there, please.
- No, I got it. It's my job.

226
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,673
No...

227
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,181
OK, that'll be 33 bucks, please.

228
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,731
OK. Oh, no. Keep the...
Keep the change.

229
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,195
- Listen. ..
- Thanks.

230
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,235
Can I ask you something?

231
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,951
Now, this is gonna sound
a little crazy to you, but, uh...

232
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,196
Well, I'm a casting agent.

233
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,825
That means that I go out
and I find people.

234
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,668
You know, for really big movies.

235
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,249
And I've been observing you.

236
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,592
And I... I honestly think
you have something special.

237
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,053
As a matter of fact,
I'm casting a part right...

238
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,344
right now that I think you'd be perfect for.

239
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,763
This is a... a terrific part.

240
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,515
You could be a movie star.

241
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:04,061
- What, like right now?
- Well, yeah.

242
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,897
I really wouldn't want to do that, you know.

243
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,648
I mean, I have a job. I really wouldn't
want to lose this job, you know.

244
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,321
I really wouldn't want
to fuck things up right now, you know.

245
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,319
You understand, right?

246
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,366
Well...

247
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,456
Let's not be hasty.

248
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,535
I'm... I'm serious
about this, you know.

249
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,836
I just want to be sure you understand
what I'm offering you.

250
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,755
Yeah, but, you know, I'm a cab driver.

251
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,753
You know, this is what I do.

252
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,472
Like I told you,
I'm gonna be a mechanic.

253
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,017
I don't want to press you.
I really don't.

254
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:47,062
But I just want to make sure
that I understand.

255
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,482
Are you saying that you...

256
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,573
you just wouldn't be interested
in being a movie star?

257
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:59,162
- Nah.
- Hey, you could be a mechanic later.

258
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,407
Everyone wants to be a movie star.

259
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,831
Look, lady.
You know, I like the movles and all.

260
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,080
And I see you're
being serious, you know.

261
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,504
But that's not a real life for me.
You know?

262
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:17,096
I mean, I'm sure there's tons of girls
who wanna be in the movies and all...

263
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,465
and, you know, I...

264
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,389
<i>I'm not saying it right.</i>

265
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,310
It's just that I have everything
planned out for me, you know?

266
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,150
I mean, everything's going
just right for me now.

267
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,190
Well, you can't beat that, can you?

268
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,993
Nope.

269
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,330
But, you know, I mean, I appreciate It.

270
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,706
- Thanks for the tip.
- You bet.

271
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,631
- Take it easy.
- Sure, mom.

272
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,719
Oh, shut up.

273
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,004
Taxi! Yeah.

274
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,973
Yo, yo, yo, yo, taxi! Shit.

275
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,513
Gotta get a taxi, man.

276
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,182
Here we go. Taxi!

277
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,182
Taxi! Yo, man. Right here.

278
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,684
Right here. Whoo! Right.

279
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,811
This is the ticket. Yo, what's up?

280
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,366
Brooklyn.

281
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,863
Brooklyn, man. Yo! Yo, man!
You suck, man!

282
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,990
I got your plate number!
I'm gonna call the TLC!

283
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,492
Come on, man.
Somebody pick me up.

284
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,371
Yeah. Come on. Pick me up. What's...

285
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,377
There's a million fuckin' cabs out here.

286
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,964
Cash, man.

287
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,805
Yeah. That's the ticket.
This is gonna get me home.

288
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,050
Shit. It's gonna get my ass home, man.

289
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,769
I got cash, man!

290
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,935
Taxi. Look. I got the cash right here.

291
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,229
Taxi. Come on, man.

292
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,318
<i>Come on, man'. Whoa, whoo...</i>

293
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,279
Fuck all y'all!

294
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,908
No, you ain't gettin'... You ain't takin'
my cab now. You ain't takin' my cab.

295
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,120
That's right. Just keep walkin'.
Yeah. That's right.

296
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:14,208
Shit. They know you desperate.
That's all it is. What am I, invisible, man?

297
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,295
I don't give a fuck. Get me a taxi.
Have my name on it, too.

298
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,432
You go to Brooklyn?

299
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,894
Hello. How are you?

300
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,648
I wanna go to Brooklyn.

301
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,690
- Uh... Come In, sir.
- All right!

302
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,483
- You know how to get to Brooklyn?
- "Brookland"?

303
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,452
Uh, better you show me.

304
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,498
Yeah. All right. Look.

305
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,335
Phew. Go straight down Broadway,
and then I'll explain as we go.

306
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,753
Hey, what's <i>up?</i>

307
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,341
What? You new at this?
You got it in park.

308
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,844
Hey, man. You gotta put it in drive.

309
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,688


310
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,306
D! D is to drive.

311
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:23,778
- Put the motherfucker in drive!
- Yeah, yeah. D is to drive.

312
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,563
So.

313
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,486
OK.

314
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,497
Hey, what's... What you doin', man?
Hey, what... Hey!

315
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,127

Just wait a minute, all right? Look at this.
You didn't even turn the meter on.

First thing you gotta do
is turn that fuckin' meter on.

363
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,560
See, it turns the light off on top.
That means you're occupied.

478
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,566
Don't be kickin' me. Don't be kickin'.

479
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,534
<i>- Sh“;

480
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,028
What you doin'?

481
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,156
Let me out of this car!

482
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,408
What the fuck is your problem, man?

483
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,501
What the fuck
is your fuckin' problem, man?

484
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,745
You're my problem!

485
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,464
- No, you're my fuckin' problem.
- Angela, don't be cursin' me out.

486
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:31,802
- Well, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
- Look, Angela. Just shut up!

487
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,966
No, you shut up.
Don't be telling me to shut up.

488
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,088
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

489
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,217
- No, you shut up!
- Shit.

490
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,350
You know what
your fuckin' problem is, YoYo?

491
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,396
You don't realise that
you're wearing your ass on your head.

492
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,443
Oh, hey, don't worry, Helmet, man.
It's just a family thing.

493
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,940
- You're not my fuckin' family.
- Look, I am your family.

494
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,569
- You ain't shit to me.
- I'm your brother-in-Iaw, all right?

495
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,163
- Angela, just calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

496
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,158
She's really beautiful.
She's beautiful.

497
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,662
- Yeah, you think so, huh?
- Yes.

498
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,914
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

499
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,132
- What's your name?
- Helmet.

500
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,551
His name is Helmet Lampshade.

501
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,765
- Or some shit like that.
- Oh, fuck you, all right?

502
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,931
- Don't fuck with me.
- No, no. My name is Helmut Grokenberger.

503
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,431
Here. You can read it.
Helmut Grokenberger.

504
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,649
<i>Great.</i>

505
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,769
I'm driving with a fuckin' idiot
and some clown.

506
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,522
Oh, yes. I am a clown.

507
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,524
Yeah, Angela. It's true.

508
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,526
- Shut up!
- No, It's true. Check It out.

509
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,573
- Shut up.
- Hey. Come on, Helmet. Show her.

510
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,744
- Do that horn thing you did, man.
- Ah, yes.

511
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,378
<i>Yes.</i>

512
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,632
That shit is so bugged, man!

513
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,005
What the hell are you doing?

514
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,682
- Thank you.
- See, what'd I tell you, Angela?

515
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,107
Helmet, man.
Forget about her.

516
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,855
Check it out, man.
Brooklyn Bridge. Right over there.

517
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,196
Oh, that's...

518
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:01,159
That's... that's beautiful.

519
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,582
All the lights.

520
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,009
Oh!

521
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,725
Like.

522
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,394
You got it, man.

523
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,157
- <i>I'm the</i> driver.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

524
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,321
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

525
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,993
Is somebody gonna tell me
what the fuck is goin' on around here?

526
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,867
- What you mean?
- What do I mean?

527
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:53,041
What the fuck are you
driving this cab for, YoYo, huh?

528
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,913
And what's up with the fuckin' hats?

529
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,381
What is this,
the fuckin' Rocky and Bullwinkle show?

530
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,173
Yes, yes.
We... we have the same hats. Both.

531
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,387
Look. Just forget about the hats.
All right?

532
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:07,600
Look. It was Helmet's first day drivin'.
He drive like shit. All right? So I took over.

533
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,312
- Oh, you took over.
- Yeah.

534
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:14,149
You know, you're a fuckin' typical
control freak. You know that?

535
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,439
- Man! Shit.
- Look. Angela, just shut up, all right?

536
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,154
Don't tell me to shut up.
I already told you about that shit.

537
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,114
- I'm telling you to shut up.
- No, you shut up!

538
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,277
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

539
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,572
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up, all right?

540
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,786
Damn.

541
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,331
You're a fuckin' idiot, YoYo.
You know that?

542
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,543
Yo, you see the sign?
It says, "Sit back in case of short stops."

543
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,412
You never know. I might stop real short.

544
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,507
You better be careful, because if I get hurt,
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.

545
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,671
- Always got to have the last word, right?
- That's right.

546
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,215
- Right.
- That's right.

547
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,928
- Right.
- Right.

548
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,515
Damn!

549
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,475
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Say somethin'. Go ahead.

550
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,847
If you fuckin' stop talkin' to me, then you
won't have to hear my fuckin' mouth.

551
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,268
So why don't you shut the fuck up?

552
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,187
And then I won't have to be talkin'
all the time, you stupid idiot.

553
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,937
- Right.
- Oh, fuck you.

554
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,939
Angela, fuck you too.
You know what you like?

555
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,033
You're like a fuckin' Chihuahua,
always gnawing at my fuckin' ankles.

556
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,745
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna take a big
fuckin' bite out of your fuckin' ass, then,

557
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,365
so you better watch out
for this little dog.

558
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,163
- Shit.
- Damn.

559
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,003
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck.

560
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:22,258
- Nice family. Nice family.
- Cos he's an asshole. That's why.

561
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,252
- Yeah. Right.
- Huh?

562
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,379
Asshole. He's an asshole.

563
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,842
Pssh. Asshole.

564
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,862
Check it out, Helmet.
This is Brooklyn.

565
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,860
What you think, man?

566
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,078
Oh, it's great.

567
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,699
It's a dump.

568
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,874
Don't be sayin' shit like that, Angela.
It's our neighbourhood.

569
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,246
Like I give a shit?

570
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,967
It's "Brookland".

571
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,540
You see, Helmet?
This is where we live.

572
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,786
- Thanks for nothin', asshole.
- Don't be hittin' on me, Angela.

573
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,630
- Oh, shut up.
- No, you shut up.

574
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,341
Goodbye to you, Angela.

575
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,718
Goodbye to you too, Helmet-head.

576
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,887
Good bye.

577
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,095
- Hey, YoYo.
- What?

578
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,313
Fuck you!

579
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,947
- Take this.
- Oh, yes.

580
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,240


581
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,408
Hey. You should count that shit.
You should always count that shit.

582
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,411
Oh.

583
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,458
<i>Ja.</i>

584
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,468
You see?

585
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,807
<i>Ja.</i>

586
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,847
It's a little less.

587
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,641
The meter say 13.
I only gave you 12.

588
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,810
Yes.

589
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,272


590
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,021
It's New York, Helmet.

591
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,240
Money is... Ja. Money...

592
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,402
is not important for me.

593
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,529
I am a clown. I... I need it.

594
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,455
It's not important... for me.

595
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,748
Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,178
So, you know how to get back
to Manhattan, Helmet?

597
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,719
Uh, we...

598
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,473
<i>- No. No.
- Shit.</i>

599
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:26,397
All right. You're gonna make the opposite
of every direction we made to get here.

600
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,318
So if we made a right,
then this time you're gonna make a left.

601
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,861
And if we made a left,
you're gonna make a right.

602
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,861
- Right?
- Ah, yeah. TWO rights.

603
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,489
No, no, no, no, no, no.

604
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,490
Helmet, look.

605
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,244
You go down there,
you make a right, then...

606
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:49,170
When you get to that wide street...
you know, that... that big one?

607
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,419
- Yeah.
- You're just gonna stop and ask somebody.

608
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,634
OK. OK, Mr Lampshade.

609
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,763
No, no, no, man. No.

610
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,512
No, man. You be Mr Lampshade.

611
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,764
- I be Mr Lampshade?
- Yeah!

612
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,938
OK. I be Mr Lampshade.

613
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,234
Honk-honk! Yeah.

614
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,448
Later for you, Helmet.

615
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,955
D is to drive.

616
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,792
Yeah. Yeah. You got it.
Yeah. D. D. D is to drive!

617
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,955
Learn some English, Helmet!

618
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,420
Right.

619
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,264
Right! Helmet, go right!

620
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,350
There's a nice family.

621
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,069
Left... or right?

622
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:21,762
Uh... Two rights. Two...

623
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,558
<i>No.</i>

624
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,559
Huh?

625
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,731
Straight.

626
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,943
Here.

627
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,409
<i>3a, ja, ja.</i>

628
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,539
Uh...

629
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,842
New York. New York.

630
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:37,360
<i>- In the bag.
- In the bag.</i>

631
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,399
<i>- Yes!
- You're quite a guy!</i>

632
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,398
<i>So am I.</i>

633
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,777
<i>We sure impressed that ambassador.</i>

634
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,243
<i>Ah!</i>

635
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,783
He's been taken in.

636
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,781
More champagne! Champagne.

637
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,749
Champagne! That's what we need.

638
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,243
The way we suckered him...

639
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,495
<i>Ah!</i>

640
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,338
- What are you doing?
- Oh!

641
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,173
- Oh, oh, oh!
- What's the matter with you?

642
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,384
We told you to drive carefully.
We're important people.

643
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:06,381
Hell, yes! Extremely important people.

644
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:08,553
If you only knew what's in this case.

645
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,301
Don't you tell him.

646
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,724
The Cameroon ambassador
wants to see us in the morning.

647
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,267
In one piece.

648
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,392
And you drive like a lizard,
first left, then right.

649
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:20,270
You think you're in your jungle here?

650
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,614
We're not from the same jungle,
are we? No.

651
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,323
Yes. Drive carefully.

652
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:29,491
These little brothers who come
to France, don't they have any respect?

653
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,240
Did you even hear him say hello?

654
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,960
Little brother, where do you
come from that you're so rude? Eh?

655
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,544
You from Togo?

656
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,414
From Gabon?

657
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,463
You can't be from Cameroon.
From Dakar?

658
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,712
Wait, I'll have a closer look.

659
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,715
<i>If his looks don't kill you.</i>

660
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,514
With that face, he might.

661
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,447
I'll tell you.
With a face like that,

662
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,158
he must be a representative
of King Beyanzed.

663
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,494
You're killing me.

664
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,786
It's true!
That's a Beninese's face!

665
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,999
That's it. Benin.

666
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:21,498
Little brother,
are you from Benin?

667
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,127
The Ivory Coast.

668
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,676
Ivory Coast.

669
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,300
He's an Ivoirien.

670
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,894
"Can't see a thing!"

671
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,310
- That explains it!
- That explains it all!

672
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,150
- He's an “Y voit rien".
- Little brother! Ivoirien!

673
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,521
You've run four red lights,

674
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,820
you're a "Can't see a thing", and you drive
at night without your glasses on.

675
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,487
<i>But pay attention...</i>

676
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:52,487
Don't leave your glasses at home!
Keep your eyes on the road.

677
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,456
Look! The road is over there!

678
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:59,202
Who gives these people cars?
An Ivoirien!

679
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,465
What do you mean, that explains it?

680
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,755
Ah?

681
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:12,007
I work from eight pm to eight am,
so don't fuck with me in my own taxi.

682
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,929
And I don't give a shit
about your ambassador, OK?

683
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:18,430
- Can't we have some fun?
- We're just having fun.

684
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,931
We've had champagne,
we're very happy...

685
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,857
No, you don't have fun in my taxi.
I work in this taxi.

686
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,572
It's my place of business,
not your fucking playground!

687
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,568
- OK, get out. Get out, get out.
- What do you mean?

688
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,570
Just get out of my taxi.

689
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,913
Little brother, I only said...

690
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,998
Forget it. Just get out.

691
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,834
- You're not serious...
- Out of my taxi!

692
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,579
But it's four in the morning.

693
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,002
But...

694
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,841
Little brother, what's wrong with you?

695
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,085
Look where you're leaving us!

696
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,472
Can you believe this guy?

697
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,512
Does he expect us to find a taxi here?

698
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,760
Huh?

699
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,774
<i>What a fucked-up day.</i>

700
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,570
Fuck.

701
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,320
Big brothers, my ass...

702
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:20,332
Shit, they didn't even pay!

703
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,202
I can't believe this shit.

704
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,884
I'll kick your ass!

705
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,838
Here's one that won't give me any shit.

706
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,017
Nice driving, asshole.
You almost flattened me.

707
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,035
What are we waiting for?

708
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,655
Quai de I'Oise,
near Porte de la Villette.

709
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,032
It's near the canal.

710
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,018
At the next intersection,

711
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,059
just follow Canal Saint-Martin
up to Stalingrad Place

712
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,977
then along quai de la Seine.

713
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:12,069
Look, I know my job.
Don't tell me how to do my job.

714
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,872
IF YOU HAVE A PREFERRED ROUTE,
INDICATE THIS TO THE DRIVER

715
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,914
Doesn't this sign say
to follow my directions?

716
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,120
What did you do?
Did you change something?

717
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,418
What, me? Nothing!

718
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,643
- Oh!
- Sorry.

719
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:30,106
Don't they teach you how to drive
before unleashing you?

720
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,567
What are we doing in this tunnel?

721
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:24,410
Why'd you take the fucking tunnel?
I didn't tell you to go this way!

722
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,330
Ugh!

723
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,824
I hate the tunnel.

724
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,881
Hold still. I got it.

725
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,976
Thanks.

726
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,766
Hey, don't blind people
usually wear dark glasses?

727
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,232
Do they? I wouldn't know.
I've never seen a blind person.

728
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,743
You've always been blind?

729
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,907
Yeah.

730
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:58,253
Must be a real drag being blind, huh?

731
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,918
Listen, jerk-off.
I can do anything you can

732
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,087
and a lot of things you'll never do.

733
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,256
I'm blind, that's all.

734
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,050
You can't drive a car, for example.

735
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,299
And you can?

736
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,857
I didn't mean to make you mad.

737
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,902
I don't know any blind people.
I'm curious, that's all.

738
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,323
I'm just like you. I'm blind,
but I drink, I eat, I taste things.

739
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:35,116
I listen to music.
I feel music.

740
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:38,165
I do whatever I want.
I even go to the movies.

741
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,165
The movies?

742
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,918
And what do you see at the movies?

743
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,180
Sometimes I feel the film.

744
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,134
I can hear it.

745
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,511
Oh, forget it.
You're a pain in the ass.

746
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:01,601
Yeah, but when you eat,
you can't see the food.

747
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,603
The carrots could be blue,
for example.

748
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,775
And with music,
you can't see the musicians!

749
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,197
You don't even know
the shape of a guitar.

750
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,946
Yes, I know the shape
of a fucking guitar.

751
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,539
I feel things I'm sure you never will.

752
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,683
OK then, if you're so smart,
let me ask you a question.

753
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,763
Here's the question.

754
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:41,436
What colour am I?

755
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,730
I don't give a fuck about colours.

756
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,567
But people have different
colours of skin!

757
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:52,068
Look, I don't care if you're green
or... blue like a carrot.

758
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,912
For me, the word colour
doesn't mean anything.

759
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,327
I feel colours.

760
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,541
But you'd never understand that.

761
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:13,385
OK. You hear my voice, my accent.

762
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,223
Tell me where I'm from.

763
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:19,266
And If I'm right, I win a colour TV,
Is that It?

764
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,731
<i>I don't know, Africa.</i>

765
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,400
From Cameroon.

766
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,773
No, the Ivory Coast.

767
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:36,369
Not bad!

768
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,581
You're exactly right! Treichville.

769
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,871
Exactly right.

770
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,894
Can I ask you something personal?

771
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,859
What now?

772
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,488
Uh...

773
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,607
What's it like in bed?

774
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,569
What in bed?

775
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:05,376
With a man, if you can't see anything,
when you make love,

776
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,372
how do you know who's next to you,

777
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:14,544
who you're making love with?

778
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,342
Listen, when I make love
it's with every centimetre of my body,

779
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,641
every pore of my skin,
unlike you, I'm sure.

780
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,648
Believe me, I know the man
I make love with.

781
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,187
Even when he's on the stairs,
I know it's him.

782
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,236
I can smell him from a block away.

783
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:40,657
<i>A block away!
He must really stink.</i>

784
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:41,904
Fuck you.

785
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,499
I'm glad I can't see you,
cos you must be an ugly bastard.

786
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,619
That's right.

787
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,464
Here we are.

788
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,507
Is this quai de I'Oise?

789
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:41,630
Yeah.

790
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,552
Which side?

791
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,472
West of the canal,
facing Porte de la Villette.

792
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,097
OK. How much is it?

793
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,562
40 francs.

794
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,774
Listen, asshole. I've been
trapped in here longer than that,

795
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,523
and I don't need your fuckin' charity.

796
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,616
It must be 48 or 49.

797
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,827
Here's 50.
Keep the change.

798
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,998
You think I was born yesterday?

799
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:29,852
Watch out for yourself!

800
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,014
Watch out yourself.

801
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,862
<i>Don't you look where you're going?
We're not in Africa here!</i>

802
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,454
<i>You're a racist!</i>

803
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:33,621
No, I'm not a racist,
but you drive like a fuckin' black!

804
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,212
The road goes this way,
and you were going that way!

805
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,547
- Are you blind or what?
- Fuck!

806
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,587
But it's not my fault!

807
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,604
<i>I can't see a thing.</i>

808
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:11,195
They could put up a street light
once in a while in Rome.

809
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,538
<i>Hm!</i>

810
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:33,388
Would you like to meet
and make love? Chh!

811
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:36,679
<i>Confirmed. I repeat,
send a car immediately.</i>

812
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,426
Where should we do it? Chh!

813
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,975
<i>- 12 Marmorata Street.
- And then? Chh!</i>

814
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:43,473
<i>- Bufalotta Street, number 40.
- And after? Chh!</i>

815
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,645
<i>Piazza Quadrata, but there is no number.</i>

816
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:49,066
OK, we'll do it in Piazza Quadrata. Chh!

817
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,781
<i>Correct, confirmed,
but there is no number.</i>

818
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:55,076
How many times will we do it? Chh!

819
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,740
<i>1,001.</i>

820
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,534
How soon? Chh!

821
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,077
<i>Five minutes. Three cars.</i>

822
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:04,828
Three taxis? You little slut!
We're through. Chh!

823
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,518
Hotel Genius.
What a name for a hotel!

824
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,770
"Good evening.
I'd like a room between...

825
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,399
"Leonardo da Vinci and Einstein.

826
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,990
"Yes, thank you.
Oh! Who's this?

827
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,700
"Dante Alighieri, how's it going?

828
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,070
"I'm here having coffee
with Shakespeare.

829
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,699
"Isaac Newton! Beethoven! Ha-ha!

830
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,496
"Beethoven, I'd like you
to meet Charlie Parker.

831
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:48,088
"Charlie Parker! You know Charlie Parker?
Charlie Parker, this is Beethoven.

832
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:51,959
"Say something to him, Charlie."

833
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,676
Charlie Parker at the Hotel Genius...

834
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,679
"If there's no room
at the Hotel Genius,

835
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,433
"I'll take a room
at the Hotel Imbecile."

836
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,743
Rome deserted.

837
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,746
Beautiful city.

838
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,831
The Romans have all left Rome.

839
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,873
Where did they go?
Everyone's in Bergamo.

840
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,166
What do they do in Bergamo?

841
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,514
I love these one-way streets!

842
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,853
So many... Oh!

843
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,724
It's like bumper cars.

844
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:52,398
Ah! "In the middle
of the journey of our life,

845
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:55,443
"oh, dear friends, to you I convey,

846
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,442
"I found myself
down a street, one way.“

847
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,037
It's a one-way street!

848
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:12,709
Hey, idiot!

849
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,755
That's right,
it's one-way, you jerk!

850
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:23,891
Oh! What?

851
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,886
This wall wasn't here yesterday!

852
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:29,856
Like Saint Pete, I will retreat.

853
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:35,104
And like the saints that led,
I'll move ahead.

854
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,064
Another one-way street!

855
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:41,693
They're always changing everything.
Fuckin' idiots...

856
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,834
I'm dangerous?

857
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,078
I've got a taxi and they've got guns,

858
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,875
and I'm dangerous!

859
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:57,967
Hah! Hah! What?

860
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,758
I'm dangerous? I should turn around
and run them both over.

861
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,639
Fuck them.

862
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,165
A bishop alone in Rome at four am!

863
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,463
Bad luck! Touch my balls.

864
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,843
Excuse me, Father.
The statue confused me.

865
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,087
I couldn't see you. Excuse me.

866
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:27,340
Across town, please. To Tiburtino.

867
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,639
Tiburtino? Not the Vatican?
Aren't you a bishop?

868
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,479
No, not the Vatican.
And I'm not a bishop.

869
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,188
OK.

870
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,135
Ahem.

871
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:10,725
Father, I want to tell you
that I'm deeply honoured

872
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,345
to have a bishop in my taxi.

873
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,143
My dear son, I'm not a bishop.

874
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,108
Yes, I know,
you're not a bishop, but...

875
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:30,112
- My son, may I ask you a favour?
- Anything, Father!

876
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,204
Could you remove your sunglasses?

877
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,621
It's not safe to drive at night
with dark glasses.

878
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:42,923
Thank you, Father!

879
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:47,387
I put them on this morning
and forgot I was wearing them.

880
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,677
I see better now. Thank you!

881
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:50,890
Hey! Thanks, Father.

882
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:55,137
I feel like a blind man
who's miraculously recovered his sight!

883
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,434
Thank you, Father. Thank you so much.

884
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,950
Father.

885
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:17,496
- Everything OK, Father?
- Everything's OK.

886
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,910
Excuse me,
but it says NO SMOKING.

887
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:56,701
That sign? I keep forgetting
to get rid of it. Sorry, Father.

888
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:02,040
They put one in every taxi.
It's ridiculous.

889
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,537
Father, I know this will sound
a little strange,

890
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,407
but here we are alone,
at night in a taxi,

891
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,452
and it's a little embarrassing,

892
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,750
but I would like to confess.

893
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:48,174
But this is not
the appropriate place, my son.

894
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,338
I know, I said it myself,

895
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:54,430
we're in a taxi, not church,
but I must confess, Father.

896
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,801
Dear son, confession is an act
that must remain anonymous.

897
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:02,021
The church must preserve
this anonymity. Otherwise...

898
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,357
But I promise I won't tell anyone!

899
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:09,229
I'm not Roman, I'm Tuscan.

900
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,401
I've had this taxi for 15 years
here in Rome,

901
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:16,198
and in 15 years, Father, I swear I've never
picked up the same person twice.

902
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,117
And even if I picked you up
again in ten years,

903
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,241
I wouldn't recognise you,
dressed as a bishop.

904
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:24,164
And I promise
I won't look you in the face.

905
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,628
After all, I've got to drive.

906
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,247
Ehh...

907
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:31,627
I must confess. Please!

908
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:37,007
You won't have to pay the fare, OK?
You won't have to pay.

909
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,931
If you don't hear my confession,
I'm afraid I'll burn in hell.

910
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:43,270
But this is unacceptable.

911
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:48,275
Father, I've got
so many sins to confess.

912
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:53,530
First thing, when I was
about 12 or 13 years old,

913
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:56,867
when boys become big men...

914
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:00,113
well, each gets his own physique...

915
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:05,460
and you begin to feel
that desire for, how can I say it...

916
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:08,875
For love! For sex!

917
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,966
You feel the need for release!

918
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,460
The.<i>..</i> Father.

919
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:19,181
You understand?
To relieve this desire to...

920
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,301
No? Look.

921
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:25,430
Anyway, I lived in the country
and there weren't many women,

922
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:29,229
and, though you're still a kid,

923
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,649
inside, you feel a man's feeling,

924
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:36,991
and there was no way to...
release this feeling.

925
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,030
And all my friends...

926
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:43,498
So the idea, not mine,
but a real intelligent friend of mine's,

927
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,616
of relieving ourselves with...

928
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,745
we made love with...
how do I say this?

929
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,298
With pumpkins. Pumpkins.

930
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:57,637
Warm, soft, damp,
with seeds inside, so round...

931
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:01,008
And we would pump...

932
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,930
Like... Help me find the words, Father.

933
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:08,728
We relieved ourselves
with these pumpkins.

934
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:13,649
0h!
But then, after a certain age, I quit.

935
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:17,865
I don't know if my friends quit,
but that's their business.

936
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:22,533
I quit because I felt, Father,
and I'm sure you'll agree,

937
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:26,327
in growing up to be a sensitive,
even religious man,

938
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:29,452
that love is something every man needs,

939
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:33,251
not with a vegetable,
but with something alive!

940
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,465
Like...

941
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:40,213
Something that moves, that's warm,
that looks you in the eyes.

942
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,681
Something with a soul.

943
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,391
Anyway, there was a...

944
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,101
a sheep.

945
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,187
A beautiful little sheep!

946
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:54,061
Father, she was nice, kind, sweet, pretty.

947
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:55,652
I called her Lola.

948
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:59,319
Not an ugly old sheep like the others,

949
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:03,160
but a little sheep, so delicate, refined!

950
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:06,701
Soft wool, two big eyes watching me.

951
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:10,668
At first, I didn't even notice.

952
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:14,789
And what a sweet little voice!

953
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:21,382
And I was enchanted.
Not like the other sheep.

954
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,880
No.

955
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:27,476
Her movements were so refined.

956
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,266
Always polite.

957
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:34,734
She'd come beside me, and somehow
I was always on top of her.

958
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,728
Father, it was beautiful.

959
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,777
She was so pretty... even erotic!

960
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,774
A beautiful little sheep.

961
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:44,026
She would embarrass me,

962
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:51,285
because she would come around
when I was with my friends.

963
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:54,754
People began to notice this.
It was embarrassing.

964
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:58,250
In fact... in fact, finally, my father noticed.

965
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:00,508
A horrible memory.

966
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,594
Do you know what my father did?

967
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,306
He sold her. He sold her to a...

968
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,596
A.--
a...

969
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,679
A butcher. A butcher. My Lola.

970
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,807
He sold my Lola to a butcher!

971
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,651
A butcher named Guido Rusticoni.

972
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:22,489
A fat, hairy, sweaty guy.
Rude, uneducated.

973
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:26,577
Really ugly, disgusting.
He was horrible.

974
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,663
My Lola to a butcher
for 80,000 lire.

975
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,329
I felt it so badly that
I haven't eaten meat since.

976
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:36,579
Even now, when they ask me,
"Do you want some lamb?"

977
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,252
"Me, lamb? No, thanks."

978
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:43,343
I don't eat vegetables either,
because of the pumpkins.

979
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:46,089
In fact, I don't eat much
at all any more.

980
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,387
It was very traumatic for me.

981
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:53,183
What I want to say is,
I understand that these are big sins,

982
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,680
I understand these are big sins,

983
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:58,559
but truly, Father, they are sins of love.

984
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,230
Oh!

985
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,581
Oh! Look out! Look out!

986
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,257
<i>- Ciao, Gino!
- Hey!</i>

987
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,055
<i>Ciao!</i>

988
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,179
- Gino, how are you?
- Hey, Rocco!

989
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,556
- Good, and you?
- <i>Ciao.</i>

990
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:40,606
Nothing's going on, really.
No customers.

991
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,398
It's a lousy night.

992
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,647
Nothing here either. A real slow night.

993
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:47,616
- We haven't made a cent.
- Nothing.

994
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:51,203
- A bishop.
- <i>A bishop?</i>

995
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,366
- A real one?
- Yes.

996
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,491
- Oh, let me see!
- What a darling little bishop!

997
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:57,083
Lovely. Yes.

998
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,203
A bishop. A bishop.

999
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,330
Hey. No. Uh...

1000
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:02,752
Yes.

1001
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,465
He's charming.

1002
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,586
OK, Gino. What's up?

1003
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:09,259
- Stop by later, OK?
- Yes.

1004
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,132
- <i>Ciao.</i>

1005
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:13,384
<i>Ciao. Thank you.</i>

1006
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,352
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

1007
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,810
<i>Ciao.</i>

1008
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,477
Gino always cheers me up.

1009
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,735
Pretty girls, eh, Father?

1010
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,951
So, my brother Vincenzo
lives here in Rome too.

1011
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:34,663
He's a plumber. Repairs pipes, water.

1012
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,782
One night, he invited me to dinner,

1013
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:40,877
he and my sister-in-Iaw, Monica.

1014
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:42,747
So I went to their house.

1015
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:46,251
They have a female dog too.
Very cute.

1016
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:50,880
So, after dinner,
he got an emergency call, and...

1017
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:56,102
The pipes exploded in a condominium.

1018
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,766
Water everywhere.

1019
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:02,642
And, like a lightning bolt,
he ran off with his tools,

1020
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,985
and I was left alone with Monica.

1021
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,651
Now, Monica is beautiful!
You should see her.

1022
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:10,616
Absolutely gorgeous.

1023
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:12,826
Very beautiful.

1024
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:14,990
And she really likes me.

1025
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:20,789
She always looks at me
with those strange “sister-in-Iaw eyes...

1026
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:24,004
At their wedding I said,
"Congratulations!"

1027
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,294
But she looked at me strangely.

1028
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,918
She married my brother,
and we're the same type.

1029
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:31,716
I'm even more handsome than he is.

1030
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,340
So Monica and I were alone.

1031
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:37,389
She started to clean up at the sink.

1032
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:41,389
As she bent over,
I was sitting behind her like this,

1033
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:45,063
and from this position I saw...

1034
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,310
two cheeks!

1035
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,278
Two cheeks!

1036
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:51,524
<i>Mamma mia!
An ass from out of this world!</i>

1037
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:53,367
With tiny white panties,

1038
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:56,533
riding up a little
so you could see one whole cheek!

1039
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:57,905
The other was partly covered.

1040
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:02,455
Father, I couldn't control myself!

1041
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:06,501
She turned and looked back at me
with those eyes...

1042
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,466
and suddenly I was on top of her.

1043
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:13,508
Father, that beautiful ass!

1044
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:17,850
Pink, soft, round like a pumpkin!

1045
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:20,640
Those soft, wool panties
reminded me of the sheep,

1046
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:23,810
The pumpkin, the sheep,
my brother's wife...

1047
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:27,435
I was on fire!

1048
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:31,405
Then we were on the floor,
under the table!

1049
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:33,023
The beauty of it!

1050
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:37,495
What pleasure! We enjoyed ourselves
like... imagine, Father...

1051
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:40,614
Heaven on earth! So beautiful!

1052
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:44,460
I said to myself,
"But this is my brother's wife!"

1053
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,545
But I couldn't stop!

1054
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,631
And I said it again,
“It's your brother's wife! Stop!"

1055
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,000
But I couldn't!

1056
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,753
<i>And it was tata-tung, tata-tung, tata-tung'!</i>

1057
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:55,345
It lasted hours!

1058
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:57,431
<i>And she screamed'. Aaaah'.</i>

1059
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:59,766
And I screamed! Aaaaah!

1060
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,931
It was terrible.

1061
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:03,599
Just beautiful.

1062
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:05,473
I turned her over,

1063
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:09,978
kissed her all over,
her neck, her perfect breasts...

1064
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,946
I stayed there all night.

1065
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,942
I never went back,
because she's my brother's wife,

1066
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:18,989
although he never noticed anything.

1067
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:21,158
Now she smiles
whenever she sees me...

1068
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,622
<i>”Ciao. Ciao.</i> ”

1069
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:26,790
And I say, "Remember when
we fucked like animals on the floor?"

1070
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,960
It was truly paradise!

1071
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:32,674
My gorgeous sister-in-Iaw! So beautiful.

1072
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:36,546
I don't know if you ever made love
with your sister-in-Iaw, Father,

1073
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:40,515
but you should try it,
because it's absolute heaven.

1074
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:43,636
Then you just confess. It's incredible.

1075
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:48,642
Father, I know these sins
must be confessed,

1076
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,768
but they were just so wonderful.

1077
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:53,566
That Monica.

1078
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,525
So beautiful.

1079
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:01,028
Eh, Father?

1080
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,031
Oh? Father?

1081
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,581
I haven't upset you, have 1, Father?

1082
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,670
I guess he fell asleep.

1083
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,752
Father.

1084
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,210
Father.

1085
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,882
Oh! Father!

1086
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:23,725
Father, don't fool around!

1087
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,016
Father!

1088
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,060
Father. Oh my. Father.

1089
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,733
Father, not feeling well?

1090
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:38,574
Father. Father.

1091
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:41,660
Father, you're not... dead, are you?
I don't hear anything!

1092
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,620
Holy shit! Father!

1093
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:46,285
Father! Father!

1094
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,082
Father. Father!

1095
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:49,792
It's me, your taxi driver! Father!

1096
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,707
I've killed him!

1097
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:53,455
Father!

1098
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,166
Father!

1099
01:31:57,262 --> 01:32:00,095
My God, what have I done?

1100
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,385
He's dead! Mamma mia!

1101
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,969
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

1102
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,561
I've killed a priest.

1103
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,182
Even worse, a bishop!

1104
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,977
They'll give me life!

1105
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,775
How many years do you get
for a bishop? 20? 30?

1106
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:18,989
Madonna!

1107
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:20,824
Father!

1108
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,863
Father, are you asleep? Ha-ha!

1109
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,829
Joking?

1110
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:28,039
He's dead. I've killed a priest!

1111
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:29,704
I'll be in all the papers.

1112
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:31,952
"TAXI DRIVER KILLS BISHOP".

1113
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:35,751
My brother will find out
everything about me and Monica!

1114
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:38,341
What a fucking mess!

1115
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:41,212
Father! Father.

1116
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:45,762
And such a nice little priest.
So nice and delicate!

1117
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:49,887
I shouldn't have told him
about the sheep and Monica!

1118
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:53,266
I'm sorry, Father.
Now I'll really burn in hell!

1119
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:55,733
Father! Father!

1120
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:58,979
Where should I put him?
Where should I put him?

1121
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:06,054
Only a priest,
but he weighs enough to be a cardinal.

1122
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:10,609
<i>40 India Street, first call.</i>

1123
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:15,360
<i>40 India Street, car needed.
Second can.</i>

1124
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:21,871
<i>Car 285 to India Street.
Thanks, 285.</i>

1125
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:30,378
<i>29 Industrial Road,
three customers waiting. First call.</i>

1126
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:35,125
<i>29 Industrial Road,
three customers. Second can.</i>

1127
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:39,254
<i>Industrial Road 29,
three customers. Third can.</i>

1128
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,802
Car 101 will take Industrial Road.

1129
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:49,515
<i>Hi, Mika! OK. Bye, bye.</i>

1130
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:52,608
Bye, bye.

1131
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,931
You called a taxi?

1132
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:08,517
No, we called a garbage truck.

1133
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:12,639
But you'll have to do the job.

1134
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,455
Is he all right?

1135
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,417
No, he's not all right.

1136
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,917
But don't worry about it.

1137
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:42,051
Let's go.

1138
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:44,046
Where?

1139
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:46,681
Home.

1140
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:49,847
My house is closest,
so drop me off first.

1141
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,641
<i>We're gonna take Nd home first.</i>

1142
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:56,316
But he lives furthest away,
and he's fucked up.

1143
01:41:56,569 --> 01:41:58,810
You're the one who's fucked up.
He's our friend,

1144
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:02,280
and in that condition, we've got
to make sure he gets home OK.

1145
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:03,568
Then you'll have to pay.

1146
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:08,241
- But I don't have any money!
- Well, I don't either!

1147
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:10,534
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1148
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,580
What about him?

1149
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,830
His severance pay.

1150
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:21,753
OK, we've got money.

1151
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,251
Let's go.

1152
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:25,469
Where?

1153
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,839
We all live on the same block.

1154
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,930
Just drive across town.

1155
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:10,431
What's your name?

1156
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,801
Mika.

1157
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:16,145
When I was a kid,
I had a hamster named Mika.

1158
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:18,310
Mika. Mika.

1159
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:21,650
- Mika. Mika.
- Mika.

1160
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,940
By the way, what was that
about his severance pay?

1161
01:43:27,827 --> 01:43:29,864
He lost his job today.

1162
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,825
Is he all right?

1163
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,287
No, he's not all right.

1164
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:41,004
Didn't he just tell you
that he lost his job today?

1165
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,675
He's all fucked up,

1166
01:43:45,928 --> 01:43:50,013
and losing his job
is just a small part of it.

1167
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:53,182
What do you mean?

1168
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:58,646
Today was the worst fuckin' day
of his entire life,

1169
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:00,856
that's what I fuckin' mean.

1170
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:06,862
Or yesterday was, anyway...

1171
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,035
I'm sorry to hear that.

1172
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:17,244
What would you know about it?

1173
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:23,877
You have no idea how he feels.

1174
01:44:25,134 --> 01:44:28,468
At the moment, I doubt
he feels much of anything.

1175
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:35,009
Look, Mr Taxi Man, don't fuck with us!

1176
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:38,933
- Be careful, you idiot! He's driving!
- You're the idiot!

1177
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:42,433
Stop! Or you morons can walk home!

1178
01:45:03,214 --> 01:45:05,046
Can I ask something?

1179
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:07,791
What?

1180
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:13,596
Your friend. What happened to him
that was so terrible?

1181
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:15,965
Besides losing his job, I mean.

1182
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:20,098
What was so terrible?

1183
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:23,977
I'll tell you what was so terrible.

1184
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:28,941
This morning,
he drives his car to work.

1185
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:31,030
New car, just paid off.

1186
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:37,529
He parks and goes to work.

1187
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:40,031
He's late for work,
but that's nothing new.

1188
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:42,909
But today, bad news.

1189
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,332
He's fired.

1190
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,580
Late once too often.

1191
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:51,001
So then he has a big fight
with his boss.

1192
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:54,425
They throw him out into the street

1193
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:57,049
and his severance pay after him.

1194
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:02,604
He picks up the envelope,
brushes himself off

1195
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:05,690
and walks back to his car.

1196
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:09,777
But instead of his brand-new car,

1197
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:16,322
there's a smashed,
fucked-up ghost of his car.

1198
01:46:16,579 --> 01:46:18,786
Smashed to fuckin' shit.

1199
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:23,374
Some fuckin' idiot
has turned his brand-new car

1200
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,789
into a useless pile of shit.

1201
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:31,086
So he has a few drinks to calm down,
then takes a bus home.

1202
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:35,462
At home, waiting for him,
are his wife and 16-year-old daughter.

1203
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:40,843
They're both crying, and the wife
tells him they have a big problem.

1204
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:46,147
Then the daughter runs off
to her room, crying.

1205
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,893
And the wife tells him that
his daughter, 16 and unmarried,

1206
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,485
is pregnant.

1207
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:54,151
A beautiful girl too, his daughter.

1208
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:59,369
You shut up! That's no way to talk
about our best friend's little daughter.

1209
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:00,828
I didn't mean it like that!

1210
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:05,200
I know what you meant,
you fuckin' slimy fungus!

1211
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:08,624
So, is that all?

1212
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:11,623
No, that's not all.

1213
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:16,090
He tells his wife that he's lost his job,

1214
01:47:16,347 --> 01:47:18,839
and then about their car.

1215
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:24,014
She becomes hysterical
and screams that she wants a divorce.

1216
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:29,065
That he's no good as a father
or a husband.

1217
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:33,194
And then she chases him from the house

1218
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:35,484
with a big fuckin' butcher's knife.

1219
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,698
- A bread knife.
- A butcher's knife!

1220
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:39,238
He said it was a bread knife!

1221
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:41,577
No, he made a point of saying
it was a butcher's knife!

1222
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:43,412
- Bread knife.
- OK, OK, OK!

1223
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,703
- Bread knife.
- OK. OK.

1224
01:48:30,713 --> 01:48:32,954
Things could have been worse.

1225
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:39,134
What could possibly be worse than that?

1226
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:44,132
OK, Mr Taxi Man.

1227
01:48:45,394 --> 01:48:49,183
Whatever happened to you
that was worse than that?

1228
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:53,065
You want me to tell you?

1229
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:55,142
<i>Yeah.</i>

1230
01:48:55,404 --> 01:48:58,522
Do you have any children?

1231
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:01,194
- I have a son.
- I have a daughter.

1232
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:05,995
I'm glad I have a son
and not a daughter.

1233
01:49:06,248 --> 01:49:08,910
You're an idiot.
A daughter is much better.

1234
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:12,331
That way you won't have a son
who'll grow up to be like you.

1235
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:15,292
Even more important, then,
in your case.

1236
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,290
In your case,
soon nothing will be important!

1237
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:21,385
Hey! Knock it off!
Or you idiots will have a long walk.

1238
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:32,105
What about the terrible story
you were about to tell us?

1239
01:49:34,902 --> 01:49:36,643
I'm married.

1240
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:39,646
- That is terrible!
- Big deal.

1241
01:49:39,907 --> 01:49:45,368
My wife and I both work hard.
She has a job, and I have two jobs.

1242
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,197
We've been saving money
because we want to have a family.

1243
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:51,495
A daughter or a son.

1244
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:56,037
For a year, we've worked
at having a baby.

1245
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:58,960
Nice work if you can get it.

1246
01:49:59,218 --> 01:50:01,926
Shut up and let him finish.

1247
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:06,259
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

1248
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,016
Eija.

1249
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:15,019
Anyway, after a while
my wife became pregnant.

1250
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:19,314
We were so happy.
My wife's belly got bigger and bigger.

1251
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:22,905
Then, in the sixth month,
she started feeling strange,

1252
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:25,820
so I took her to the hospital
right away.

1253
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:29,696
Was she all right?

1254
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:33,825
Well, I took her to the hospital
and they took her inside.

1255
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:37,169
I was worried,
waiting and waiting for hours.

1256
01:50:38,423 --> 01:50:40,255
Finally, the doctor came and told me

1257
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:42,546
that Eija had a baby.

1258
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:48,264
She was all right, and the baby,
a little girl, was alive.

1259
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:52,097
I was so happy
I was about to explode.

1260
01:50:52,354 --> 01:50:54,265
- A little daughter.
- Ya.

1261
01:50:56,942 --> 01:50:58,933
But the doctor looked worried.

1262
01:50:59,903 --> 01:51:01,985
He told me the baby
was way too early.

1263
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:06,941
So far she was OK,
but she was in an incubator.

1264
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:10,114
And then he said...

1265
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:13,873
there was almost no chance
the baby would live.

1266
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:24,171
So what happened?

1267
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:29,802
The next day, I brought my wife home
from the hospital,

1268
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:33,184
but the baby stayed there
in the incubator.

1269
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:37,059
You should have seen her, though.

1270
01:51:38,066 --> 01:51:40,307
So tiny and perfect.

1271
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,856
Tiny hands, tiny feet.

1272
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:47,899
She was shaped like a little peanut.

1273
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,374
But the doctor didn't
give us much hope.

1274
01:51:57,628 --> 01:52:01,246
He said she wouldn't live
more than a week,

1275
01:52:01,506 --> 01:52:03,543
our tiny daughter.

1276
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:07,885
Eija was so scared
that she was about to go crazy.

1277
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:10,254
So I made a big decision.

1278
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:13,928
I decided that I wouldn't love
this tiny little child.

1279
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:19,142
If she was going to die, I would
have to stay strong and distant.

1280
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:23,233
I couldn't stand the pain
of losing this child.

1281
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:28,151
So I decided to kill my love.

1282
01:52:37,042 --> 01:52:40,410
A week went by, and the baby lived.

1283
01:52:43,924 --> 01:52:47,667
Then another week went by,
and part of a third.

1284
01:52:49,137 --> 01:52:52,846
After three entire weeks,
the child was still alive.

1285
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:55,762
But the doctor was still very negative.

1286
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:58,056
That started to make me angry.

1287
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:01,809
I sat up all night in the kitchen

1288
01:53:02,067 --> 01:53:04,479
while my poor wife lay awake
in the bedroom.

1289
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:09,318
And I sat there, just as the dawn
was about to break.

1290
01:53:10,617 --> 01:53:13,325
The light outside
was just like it is right now.

1291
01:53:14,997 --> 01:53:18,410
Then Eija came to me
and said I'd made a mistake.

1292
01:53:19,793 --> 01:53:21,704
I realised she was right.

1293
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:25,876
If that baby was going to make it,
it needed all my love.

1294
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:28,750
The strongest love possible.

1295
01:53:29,761 --> 01:53:31,092
It was a relief.

1296
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:39,140
I felt my love for that baby surge
through every pore of my worthless body.

1297
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:44,766
I felt so happy and clear.

1298
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:49,817
That little peanut was our child,

1299
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:53,065
and we cried out of happiness.

1300
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:56,194
We tried to eat some breakfast,
but we couldn't.

1301
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:02,449
Then we drove to the hospital.

1302
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:06,705
We wanted that baby to feel
all the strength of our love.

1303
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,337
At the hospital,
the doctor was right there to meet us.

1304
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:17,301
His face was very serious.

1305
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:21,143
He took us aside.

1306
01:54:22,481 --> 01:54:25,143
And then he told us
that a short time earlier,

1307
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,107
just before sunrise,

1308
01:54:27,361 --> 01:54:29,022
the baby had died.

1309
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:31,395
Nothing could be done.

1310
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:35,115
It was too late...

1311
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:56,636
Hey.

1312
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:58,881
Don't worry.

1313
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:02,260
You and your wife can make
another baby.

1314
01:55:05,315 --> 01:55:07,477
Maybe we can, sometime.

1315
01:55:11,363 --> 01:55:13,695
Such a sad story.

1316
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:20,285
You're a good guy, Mika.

1317
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:24,956
Aki is so full of shit.

1318
01:55:27,295 --> 01:55:30,037
His life isn't so terrible after all.

1319
01:55:30,298 --> 01:55:33,086
He fuckin' whines
about such trivial shit.

1320
01:55:33,343 --> 01:55:37,302
Some people have got real troubles.

1321
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,845
You're right, Mika.

1322
01:55:46,273 --> 01:55:48,355
You're a good man.

1323
01:55:51,945 --> 01:55:54,232
Hey.

1324
01:55:54,489 --> 01:55:56,526
We're almost home.

1325
01:55:57,451 --> 01:56:01,285
Take the next right, then a left.
That's our street.

1326
01:56:02,497 --> 01:56:05,615
What about your friend?
Is he OK now?

1327
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:08,163
- Fuck him.
- Yeah, forget about him.

1328
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:11,583
What about his wife,
and the big knife?

1329
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,081
What knife?

1330
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,674
Oh, that. Fuck it.

1331
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:22,423
He'll push his way into one of our houses
if he can't get into his own.

1332
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:25,388
He's a leech, anyway.

1333
01:57:32,337 --> 01:57:36,752
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

1334
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:41,673
Yeah. And send greetings
to your wife, Eija.

1335
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:44,012
Yeah, give her my best too.

1336
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:57,415
<i>Hey. Nd.</i>

1337
01:58:57,672 --> 01:58:59,709
<i>Wake up, AK“!</i>

1338
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:06,174
Who the fuck are you?

1339
01:59:07,641 --> 01:59:09,097
Where the fuck am I?

1340
01:59:09,351 --> 01:59:12,389
You're in a fucking taxi,
near your fucking home

1341
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:14,728
and you owe me the fucking fare.

1342
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:21,606
Yeah, I know. Nothin' for free.

1343
01:59:35,794 --> 01:59:37,831
Thanks.

1344
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:53,888
You all right?

1345
01:59:57,232 --> 01:59:59,564
You know where you are?

1346
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:02,017
Yeah.

1347
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,020
Helsinki.

1348
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:12,466
Morning, Aki.

1349
02:01:12,724 --> 02:01:14,715
Morning.
